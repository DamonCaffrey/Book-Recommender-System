# Book Recommender System

This project is a book recommender system that recommends books to users based on collaborative filtering techniques. It uses a 
pre-populated dataset obtained from Kaggle, which can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/book-recommendation-dataset. 
The project also includes a web scraping module that uses Python's BeautifulSoup and requests libraries to obtain additional information 
about recommended books. The project also includes a Flask web application that allows users to interact with the system through a user 
interface.

## Installation

To use the book recommender system, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. 

## Usage

To run the Flask web application, you will need to run the app.py file. 
You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```

```

This will start the web server, and you can access the application on a web browser. 
From there, you can navigate to different sections of the application, including the Home, Library and Recommend sections.
